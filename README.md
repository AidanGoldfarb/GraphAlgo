# Graph Algorithms
Implementation of a Graph in java, as well as some algorithms.

### Algorithms
- DFS
  - Depth first search. Currently outputs nothing.
- ConnectionTest
  - Tests whether a graph is connected 
- 2 Color Test
  - Tests whether a graph can be legally two colored
- Cycle Test
  - Detects if any cycles are present
- Topological Sort
  - Topologically sorts the DAG
- Graph Reverser
  - Reverses a directed graph
- Strong Connection Test
  - Tests whether a graph is strongly connected
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Returns shortest path between a given source node and all other nodes in graph
